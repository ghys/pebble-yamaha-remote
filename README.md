# Yamaha AV Remote (for Pebble smartwatches)

A simple control watchapp for the basic functions of your network-enabled Yamaha AV receiver. Never look for the remote again!

- Near real-time status updates, no need to refresh manually

(1) Ensure the 'Network Standby' feature is activated to be able to control/turn on the device when in standby mode.
